## 1.2 Elements of Programming

### 1.2.1 Expression

### Call Expressions
This call expression has subexpressions: the operator is an expression that precedes parentheses, which enclose a comma-delimited list of operand expressions.  
The order of the arguments in a call expression matters.   
calculating order: first operand, second operand ...

### 1.2.3 Importing Library Functions

### 1.2.4 Names and the Environment
When a name is bound to a new value through assignment, it is no longer bound to any previous value.  

### 1.2.5 Evaluating Nested Expressions
- Evaluate the operator and operand subexpressions, then
- Apply the function that is the value of the operator subexpression to the arguments that are the values of the operand subexpressions.
  
### 1.2.6 The Non-Pure Print Function
- Pure Function
  - just return values
- Non-Pure Function
  - have side effects

- None
  - A function that does not explicitly return a value will return None
  - None is not displayed by the interpreter as the value of an expression
